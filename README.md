# Advance Parking System (Our FYP)

This repository contains the codebase for our **Final Year Project**: an **AI and IoT-based Car Parking System**. The system leverages advanced technologies such as **face detection** and **IoT sensors** (camera, radar) to enhance parking security in both urban and rural areas.

## Project Overview

Our project focuses on improving the security and efficiency of parking systems using modern technologies. It is designed to provide seamless parking solutions while ensuring robust security through face recognition. The system includes:

- **AI Model**: Utilizes face detection for security verification and access control.
- **IoT Integration**: Camera sensors and radar for vehicle detection and parking management.
- **Urban and Rural Compatibility**: Tailored to suit the unique requirements of both urban and rural areas.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Ensures secure access by verifying the identity of users.
- **IoT Sensors**: Tracks vehicle movement and parking space availability.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides live updates on parking slots and system activity.
- **Security-Based System**: Designed to prioritize safety and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Scalable Design**: Can be deployed in various locations, including malls, offices, and public areas.
